# TvConvertNew
My newest version of TV convert 

My plan for this project!

This little project is about letting my friends use ffmpeg even though they have no idear what a command line is.
I plan to write a little GUI that myself and my friends can use to resample TV programs from the usb recording most digital televisions
provide these days to a format that can be watched on most devices (eg) PC's android devices and so on.
And I also think a little interface to download youtube media that will convert mp4's to mp3's and slice whole albums up 
into nice single mp3's. Anyway this is the begining of some fun and interesting programming.
Im going to add features as i come up with them... Pretty loose plan but thats changing.. Let me see what i can accomplish.
